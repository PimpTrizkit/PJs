&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*"This is what I write my JavaScript in." - PT*

Pimped Javascript - Just a library of my javascript functions and shims. They are generally built for speed, size, versatility, and portability (copy and paste-able). Readability will be sacrificed, because they are optimized for usage right out-of-the-box. Therefore, this documentation will have to make up for that.

As you can see, a number of the functions are simple. For these, the real work will be to help the documentation and in formalizing a standard.

*Speaking of which, here is the needed help for all of them:*
* *Documentation*
* *Formalizing standards*
* *Some of these are old and might have already been incorporated into newer javascript standards (excluding aliases).*
* *Debuging/Testing/Refining*
* *More quick and simple features and versatility improvements*


NOTE: None of these functions (files) are meant to be linked in separately. They are to be copied and pasted into the `head` of your HTML on a "as desired" basis.

NOTE: I have used all of these functions in various situations and feel good about their performance. But, I have not fully added all practical features yet, nor tested in all relevant situations. Please feel free to chime in.

Also, this list is still incomplete.
